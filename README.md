# Replication Package for paper 'An Empirical Study of Self-Consistency and Confidence Elicitation in LLM-Based Pointwise Re-Ranking'


This directory contains the replication materials and results for three datasets used in this paper:

- **dl19**  
- **dl20**  
- **touche**

Each dataset folder has two subfolders, **RQ1** and **RQ2**, corresponding to the two research questions addressed in the study.

---

## RQ1 Folder

Within the **RQ1** folder of each dataset, you will find:

- One CSV file and one JSON file for **each** temperature setting.  
- These files contain the experimental outcomes for **RQ1** at the specified temperature levels.

## RQ2 Folder

Within the **RQ2** folder of each dataset, there are two subfolders:

1. **ConstantTemperature**  
2. **DifferentTemperatures**

Each of these subfolders contains three additional folders, one for each of the **aggregation methods** considered in RQ2.  
The structure can be summarized as follows:
