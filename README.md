# Replication Package for paper 'An Empirical Study of Self-Consistency and Confidence Elicitation in LLM-Based Pointwise Re-Ranking'

This directory contains the replication materials and results for three datasets used in this paper:

. dl19
. dl20
. touche

Each dataset folder has two subfolders, RQ1 and RQ2, corresponding to the two research questions addressed in the study:

RQ1 Folder
Within the RQ1 folder of each dataset, you will find:

One CSV file and one JSON file per temperature setting.
These files contain the experimental outcomes for Research Question 1 at the specified temperature levels.

RQ2 Folder
Within the RQ2 folder of each dataset, there are two subfolders:

ConstantTemperature
DifferentTemperatures
Each of these subfolders contains three more folders, one for each of the aggregation methods considered in RQ2.
